## Design Goals / Approach

- Enjoyable shopping experience and a user-friendly UI.
- Mobile responsiveness.
- Using React Context to have a better management of the state of shopping cart and favorite items.
- Having a separate style sheet for each component to improve readability and flexibility of styles.

---

## Features

- The application enables the user to add items to the shopping cart.
- There are size variations on each item.
- Items can be added to the favorite list.
- The stock levels on each item gets updated when the purchase is finalized.

## Known issues

- The carousel component looks off-centre on some screen sizes due to the sliding style I have used for it. I will fix this issue on the next update.
- Currently the user cannot add two variations of the same item to the cart. I will fix this issue on the next update.

## Future Goals

- Adding pagination to the available items.
- Adding tests to the components.
